                <p>You find yourself inside a crumbling Aztec temple. The air is thick with dust, and the distant rumble of collapsing stone echoes throughout the chamber. <br><br>You hear the creak of ancient wood and the thunderous sound of rocks shifting as the temple slowly begins to fall apart. You must act fast.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In front of you, there are only two exits: <br><br> 1. A tarnished door leading to a room with an old, rusted weapon mounted on the wall <br><br>2. A passageway engulfed in vines leading to  set of ancient inscriptions carved into the stone. <br><br>The choice is yours, but be careful—time is running out.</p>
