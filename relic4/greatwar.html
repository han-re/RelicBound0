                <p>As you advance, you notice carvings on shattered stone tablets, depicting a battle beyond imagination. The greatest superhero, wielding cosmic energy, led an army of warriors against an alien horde that sought to consume the planet. <br><br>Explosions of raw power turned the skies red, and the ground quaked beneath the weight of destruction. At the war's climax, a fearless warrior, once a hero himself, was cursed to remain in this realm—forever bound to protect the last and most powerful relic. His identity lost to time, only his duty remains.</p>
                <p>At the war's climax, there was one warrior who refused to fall. Once a noble champion of humanity, he fought with unmatched skill and valor, earning the title of The Eternal Blade. But when the final battle reached its peak, he was mortally wounded.<br><br>Rather than let him die, the gods of war cursed him with immortality—binding him to the battlefield, ensuring that as long as the war's relic remained, so too would he. Time eroded his name and his memories, leaving only a single purpose: to guard the Omega Sigil from all who would claim it.</p>
