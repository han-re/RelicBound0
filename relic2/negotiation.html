    <p>"You ask to borrow the heart of my kingdom, the relic upon which my people’s prosperity depends. It is not mine to give lightly, nor its absence a burden we could bear. Since you cannot prove to me that in its absence, my kingdom will not suffer, and that in your hands, it will return undamaged, I cannot accept such a bargain."</p>
