Demonstration of the game in action, slides are not expected to be used.

Structure:
1. Opening: briefly introduce and contextualise the game (max 1 minute).
2. A successful playthrough of the game (player wins). Ensure you take enough time so that the environment
  created through the game can be appreciated and graded accordingly. Rushing over parts may impact your grade.
3. An unsuccessful playthrough of the game (player fails). Again, ensure that you dedicate enough time to this
  so the experience may be appreciated.
4. Conclude with a summary of ‘best bits’ in terms of technical complexity and quality of experience.


Each member of the group presents for ‘roughly’ an equal amount of time. (NO MORE THAN 2MINS EACH)
Within Points 2-4, all the areas described in the PowerPoint slides must be demonstrated.
Group members should introduce themselves (just their name) when they begin presenting.
