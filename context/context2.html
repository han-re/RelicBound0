                <p>The battlefield is in ruins. Fires burn, the air is thick with smoke, and the last remnants of your team struggle to stand. The final boss, a towering figure cloaked in shadow, stands over you, their weapon raised for the finishing blow.</p>
                <br>
                <p>BOSS: "This is the end. Your resistance was admirable, but ultimately... futile."</p>
                <br>
                <p>You struggle to move, gripping your wounds. Your vision blurs. Just as the boss swings, time seems to slow. A mysterious figure cloaked in light steps forward, extending a hand.</p>
