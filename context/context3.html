                <br>
                <p>Before you can react, the figure presses a glowing symbol onto your forehead. A surge of energy courses through you. The battlefield fades, and in a blinding flash, you are flung into the depths of time.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Darkness. Silence. You realise this is your destiny... "BlOOBLAH getting rocked on everyone but my soul." ......... "Type shi" echos the Mysterious Figure.</p>
